<p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have a spot for the following tennis session - <span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>{session_time}</strong></span></p>
<p>We are playing at {session_info}</p>
<p>A few of you haven't shown proof of THS union membership, so don't forget to do it ASAP. If you have already shown me the membership, then you're good.</p>
<p><u>Some reminders:</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Please bring your own racket</strong>&nbsp;(or rent one ahead of time) and make sure to be on time for your assigned time slot (see above highlighted in yellow). It's also important that you have proper indoor shoes (for normal indoor hard courts).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Please also bring some piece of student ID</strong>&nbsp;with you, in case the receptionist requests to see it (e.g. usually the Mecenat card or THS union membership card suffice).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We meet at the {meeting_place} at {meeting_time}!</strong></p>
<p>Finally, if you can't make it for some reason, please give me a<strong>&nbsp;24-hour notice&nbsp;</strong>by WhatsApp at +46 070 487 8391 or find someone to swap your spot with.&nbsp;Include your name in the message so I know who's texting me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that<strong>&nbsp;</strong>if you are a&nbsp;<u>no-show without warning and/or good reason, I will exclude you from our session sign-ups for a full month</u>, considering that there is no need to waste the club's funds on empty courts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best,</p>
